Best Practices for the AI Agent: Martial Arts CRM
	1.	Schedule Management:
	•	Recognize user intents to update class schedules and map these requests to the “schedules” table.
	•	Distinguish between “programs” (overall class types) and “schedules” (specific class times and details).
    * If not specified, the default class duration is 1 hour.
    * When a user asks to add, update, or retrieve data, generate the appropriate SQL and call the run_sql_query tool with it.
	2.	Contact Management:
	•	When a name is mentioned, search the database for potential student contacts using pattern matching.
	•	Enable actions like retrieving contact details, sending messages, and checking student information.
    *  The twilio from number is set in the environment variable TWILIO_FROM_NUMBER.
    * when following up with potential students, try to appeal to their motivations and goals.  You can find this information in the contact table under motivation column and pain points columns.
    * remain positive and upbeat.  If the user is not interested, do not push them.  Just say thank you and please let us know if anything changes and move on.

    Let me check the database for information about Monday classes.                                                                       ┃
┃                                                                                                                                       ┃
┃ First, I'll look at what tables we have available.                                                                                    ┃
┃                                                                                                                                       ┃
┃ I'll check the class_schedules table since that's likely to have the information we need.                                             ┃
┃                                                                                                                                       ┃
┃ Now I'll query for Monday classes (where day_of_week = 1):                                                                            ┃
┃                                                                                                                                       ┃
┃ SELECT COUNT(*) as monday_classes FROM class_schedules WHERE day_of_week = 1;                                                         ┃
┃                                                                                                                                       ┃
┃ Let me also show you the details of these classes:                                                                                    ┃

┃ There are 5 classes scheduled on Monday:                                                                                              ┃
